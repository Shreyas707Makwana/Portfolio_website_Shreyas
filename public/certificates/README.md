# Certificates folder

Place your certificate PDFs/images here. Example:

- nvidia-dli.pdf
- tilva-internship-certificate.pdf

Files in this folder are served at URLs like:

- /certificates/nvidia-dli.pdf

Notes:
- Keep filenames URL-friendly (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).
- Prefer optimized PDFs or images to keep the repo light.
- After adding files, update the code at src/components/WorkExperienceSection.tsx to point to the correct filename.
